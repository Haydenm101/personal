            <p>I am a student at Iowa State University currently stufying Computer Science. I am a sophmore, currently
                taking ComS 319 and ComS 321. I hope by the end of this semester I will master
                web developing skills such as HTML, CSS, and React.</p>

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                    only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                    creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                    Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                    text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                    two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                    related to the project itself.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>During my freshman year of college, I built a task manager application in 
                    Java with a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX. The program allowed 
                    users to create, edit, and delete tasks while assigning due dates and priority levels. 
                    I implemented an ArrayList to store tasks and used serialization to save and load data, 
                    so tasks would persist between sessions. To improve usability, I added sorting and 
                    filtering features, letting users view tasks by priority or upcoming deadlines. 
                    This project helped me develop a better understanding of object-oriented programming, 
                    event-driven design, and basic file handling in Java. It was a great hands-on learning 
                    experience that reinforced my skills in GUI development and data management.</p>
